Raised arms pose is your basic morning stretch, but focus on keeping the good alignment. Stay grounded in the heels and keep your shoulders moving away from your ears at the same time that you reach up through your fingertips. Your gaze can come up to the hands, which can be shoulder's width apart or palms touching."},{id:2,title:"standing forward bend",img:i(34).default,desc:"Exhale and fold over your legs into a forward bend. If the hamstrings feel a little tight at first, bend the knees so that you can release your spine. Let the head hang heavy. Keep the legs gently bent with feet hip-width apart for better stability (you can straighten the legs, but it is not necessary). You can clasp opposite elbows with opposite hands while swaying gently side to side."},{id:3,title:"garland pose",img:i(35).default,desc:"Move your feet out to the edges of your mat and bend your knees, coming into a squat. The toes may turn out if necessary. If your heels do not reach the floor, you can sit on two stacked blocks. This modification makes the pose more accessible for many people. This is a position that is quite natural for children, but we lose the knack for it as adults. It's great for the hips and to counteract the effects of too much sitting in chairs and riding in cars. It's also a very useful pose if you like to garden."},{id:4,title:"seated forward bend",img:i(36).default,desc:"On an exhalation, bring your torso over your legs in a forward bend. Allow a gentle bend in the knees to keep this pose simple and manageable. Work with your breath, lengthening the spine on each inhale and deepening your forward fold on each exhale. Stay for five breaths, keeping the feet flexed."},{id:5,title:"child's pose",img:i(37).default,desc:"Child's pose is really important because it's the position you assume whenever you need a break during a yoga class. If you ever feel fatigued, you don't have to wait for the teacher to call for a break. Just move into Child's pose and rejoin the class when you're ready. It provides a gentle stretch for the back, hips, thighs, and ankles, but does not challenge strength or balance. Taking Child's pose is really up to your discretion, which happens to introduce one of yoga's best lessons: being attuned to the signals your body is giving and respecting them above any external directions. "},{id:6,title:"downward facing dog",img:i(38).default,desc:"The name Downward Facing Dog goes hand in hand with yoga, but just because you've heard of this pose doesn't mean it's easy to do. Beginners often lean too far forward in this posture, making it more like a plank. Instead, remember to keep your weight mostly in your legs and reach your hips high, with your heels stretching toward the floor (they do not need to touch the floor). Bend your knees a little to facilitate the move if you have tight hamstrings. Keep feet parallel."},{id:7,title:"cobra pose",img:i(39).default,desc:"Cobra is done multiple times per class in flow yoga as part of the vinyasa sequence of poses. While a full cobra with straight arms offers a deeper backbend, you'll build more back strength by doing low Cobras in which you lift your chest without pressing into your hands. Root into feet, lengthen out through the crown of the head and broaden through collar bones as you lift the sternum. It's also key to anchor your pelvis to the floor before you lift up. "},{id:8,title:"tree pose",img:i(40).default,desc:"Tree pose is a good introduction to balancing postures. If you feel yourself beginning to topple, you can step out of it easily. Try not to create a counterbalance by jutting your hip out to the side on your standing leg. Focus your gaze on a spot on the floor, and try varying foot positions to see what works for you: Heel resting low on the ankle, on a block, or above or below the knee. "},{id:9,title:"triangle pose",img:i(41).default,desc:"The Triangle can be modified in a manner similar to Extended Side Angle, using a yoga block for your bottom hand if you aren't comfortable reaching your arm all the way to the floor. You can also rest your hand higher up on your leg\u2014on your shin or your thigh\u2014but avoid putting it directly on your knee. Don't hesitate to micro-bend both knees if the pose feels uncomfortable. This won't look or feel like a pronounced bend, but rather, just enough of a movement to unlock your knees and ease tension in your hamstrings. Triangle offers many benefits: Strength (in the legs), flexibility (in the groin, hamstrings, and hips, as well as opening the chest and shoulders), and balance."},{id:10,title:"bridge pose",img:i(42).default,desc:"Bridge pose is a gentle way to start exploring spine extension, also known as a backbend. It's a good idea to start incorporating this type of movement because it improves the mobility of your spine and counters the effects of too much sitting. If Bridge seems too intense, try a \u200bsupported bridge with a block. Remember to root into the feet, which helps you use your leg muscles to support the pose."},{id:11,title:"staff pose",img:i(43).default,desc:"Staff pose is akin to a seated version of mountain pose, in that it offers alignment guidelines for a host of other seated poses. Engage the leg muscles and flex the feet. Lift the chest and relax the shoulders. You can also allow a gentle bend in the knees, which can create ease for the shoulders to stack over the hips.Modify by using a block or a folded blanket or two if you have trouble sitting up straight with your butt flat on the floor.
