You can clasp opposite elbows with opposite hands while swaying gently side to side."

If your heels do not reach the floor, you can sit on two stacked blocks. This modification makes the pose more accessible for many people. This is a position that is quite natural for children, but we lose the knack for it as adults. It's great for the hips and to counteract the effects of too much sitting in chairs and riding in cars. It's also a very useful pose if you like to garden."

If you ever feel fatigued, you don't have to wait for the teacher to call for a break. Just move into Child's pose and rejoin the class when you're ready. It provides a gentle stretch for the back, hips, thighs, and ankles, but does not challenge strength or balance. Taking Child's pose is really up to your discretion, which happens to introduce one of yoga's best lessons: being attuned to the signals your body is giving and respecting them above any external directions.

Beginners often lean too far forward in this posture, making it more like a plank. Instead, remember to keep your weight mostly in your legs and reach your hips high, with your heels stretching toward the floor (they do not need to touch the floor). Bend your knees a little to facilitate the move if you have tight hamstrings. Keep feet parallel."

While a full cobra with straight arms offers a deeper backbend, you'll build more back strength by doing low Cobras in which you lift your chest without pressing into your hands. Root into feet, lengthen out through the crown of the head and broaden through collar bones as you lift the sternum. It's also key to anchor your pelvis to the floor before you lift up. "

You can also rest your hand higher up on your leg—on your shin or your thigh—but avoid putting it directly on your knee. Don't hesitate to micro-bend both knees if the pose feels uncomfortable. This won't look or feel like a pronounced bend, but rather, just enough of a movement to unlock your knees and ease tension in your hamstrings. Triangle offers many benefits: Strength (in the legs), flexibility (in the groin, hamstrings, and hips, as well as opening the chest and shoulders), and balance."

It's a good idea to start incorporating this type of movement because it improves the mobility of your spine and counters the effects of too much sitting. If Bridge seems too intense, try a ​supported bridge with a block. Remember to root into the feet, which helps you use your leg muscles to support the pose."

Lift the chest and relax the shoulders. You can also allow a gentle bend in the knees, which can create ease for the shoulders to stack over the hips.Modify by using a block or a folded blanket or two if you have trouble sitting up straight with your butt flat on the floor. In a typical yoga practice, this pose leads into a forward bend."
